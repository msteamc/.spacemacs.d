** 22:48 下定决心弥补数学知识
<2019-11-11 Mon 23:01>

微积分，数学分析，实分析，泛函分析，常微分方程，偏微分方程（数学物理方法）
线性代数，矩阵分析
概率论，随机过程，

学完这些数学课程，开始学习信号处理。还有部分计算机算法的课程（这些可以说是工程技
术）。

物理也可以看起来了。
物理主要是：大学物理，朗道物理，伯克利物理学系列

艺术方面我准备在音乐绘画上多下点功夫。

另外学习方法论也要多掌握一些。

** 23:08 关于微积分的一些想法

首先我先把俄罗斯的那套教材重新温习一边，然后把普利斯顿的微积分教材刷一边，熟悉英
语表达。

然后按照[[*22:48 %E4%B8%8B%E5%AE%9A%E5%86%B3%E5%BF%83%E5%BC%A5%E8%A1%A5%E6%95%B0%E5%AD%A6%E7%9F%A5%E8%AF%86][22:48 下定决心弥补数学知识]] 所列的顺序开始刷教材。

** 20:29 需要定下每日计划

尽管之前也有重温微积分的打算，但是我必须每日都必须对三件事情有所投入时间：
1. 微积分；
2. 信号与系统；
3. manim;

对这些投入需要形成笔记.
** 20:42 introduction                                   :ss:

While students studying signals and systems should certainly have a solid
foundation in disciplines based on the laws of physics, they must also have a
solid foundation in disciplines based on the laws of physics, they must also
have a firm grounding in the use of computers for the analysis of phenomena
and the implementation of systems and algorithms. As a consequence, engineering
curricula now reflect a blend of subjects, some involving continuous-time models
and others focusing on the use of computers and discrete representations. For
these reasons, signals and systems courses that bring discrete-time and
continuous-time concepts together in a unified way play an increasingly
important role in the education of engineering students and in their preparation
for current and future developments in their chosen fields.

It has pedagogical advantage by taking both the continuous-time and
discrete-time in mind.

Chapter 1 introduces block diagram representations of interconnections of
systems and discusses several basic system properties such as causality,
linearity and time-invariance.

The concepts of signals and systems arise in a wide variety of fields, and the
ideas and techniques associated with these concepts play an important role in
such diverse areas of science and technology such communications, aeronautics
and astronautics, circuit design, acoustics, seismology, biomedical engineering,
energy generation and distribution systems, chemical process control, and speech
processing. Because of its importance, it worth to take time to digest each
single idea and concept appearing in such course. Also, it will be greatly
helpful for the newbie to have an open course to help them dive into the world
of signals and systems. I tried my best to give the best explanation of the
concept in this course and comprehensive details are given during my creation of
videos and posts. It takes time to produce one piece of work so that sometimes I
think it was a grind. However, for the sake of beautiful result, I pretty enjoy
the process of doing such creation.

The signals, which are functions of one or more independent variables, contains
information about the behavior or nature of some phenomenon, whereas the systems
respond to particular signals by producing other signals or some desired
behavior.

Examples:
1. Voltages and currents as a function of time in an electrical circuit are
   examples of signals. and a circuit is itself an example of a system, which in
   this case responds to applied voltages and currents.
2. As another example, when an automobile driver depresses the accelerator
   pedal, the automobile responds by increasing the speed of the vehicle.
3. A computer program for the automated diagnosis of electrocardiograms can be
   viewed as a system which has as its input a digitized electrocardiogram and
   which produces estimates of parameters such as heart rate as outputs.
4. A camera is a system that receives light from different sources and reflected
   from objects and produces a photograph.
5. A robot arm is a system whose movements are the response to control inputs.


The purpose of signals ans systems:
1. characterizing the system in detail to understand how it will respond to
   various inputs.
2. design systems to process signals in particular ways. such enhancement and
   restoration of certain signals, extraction of specific pieces of information
   from signals.
3. modify or control the characteristics of a given system.

** 22:02 manim 的使用 :manim:
如果要预览，请使用 =-p= 选项 。

今天看了 3b1b 的视频觉得我距离熟练使用 =manim= 还有很远的差距，要努力。

另外在 brillant 的网站上，我觉的我仍然有必要把 blender 学习一下，这样我才可能把我
的小袋鼠给画出来。

** 23:27 brillant 网站
今天在 3b1b 的网站上找到了一个网站叫做 brillant.org 这个网站上有大约 60 个课程，我
也可以按照这 60 个课程来做。每一个课程都是一个 course。

[[https://brilliant.org/daily-problems/][Daily Challenges | Brilliant]] is the daily challenges.
