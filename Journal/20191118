This section is from [[http://www.di.univr.it/documenti/OccorrenzaIns/matdid/matdid744681.pdf][Signals-and-Systems.ppt]]  by Gloria Menegaz. The textbook
is : /Signal Processing and Linear Systems/ by B.P. Lathi, CRC Press.

*** definition of signals and systems
[2019-11-24 Sun 16:41]

A signal is defined as any physical quantity that varies with time, space, or
any other independent variable or variables. Mathematically, we describe a
signal as a function of one or more independent variables.

By Wilson J. Rugh, a continuous-time signal is a quantity of interest that
depends on an independent variable, where we usually think of the independent
variable as time. In the real world, physical quantities take on real numerical
values, though it turns out that sometimes it is mathematically convenient to
consider /complex-valued functions of t/. However, the default is real-valued
\(x(t)\), and indeed the type of sketch exhibited about is valid only for
real-valued signals.

Remarks:
1. A continuous-time signal is not necessarily a continuous function as defined
   in calculus. They are two different definition.
2. The independent variable need not to be time, it could has other meaning. But
   considering it as time does not affect we study the concepts of signals and
   systems.

A discrete-time signal is a sequence of values of interest, where the integer
index can be thought of as a time index, and the values in the sequence
represent some physical quantity of interest. Because many discrete-time signals
arise as equally-spaced samples of a continuous-time signal, it is often more
convenient to think of the index as the "sample number".



*** summary of chapter 1
[2019-11-24 Sun 15:41]

We developed a number of basic concepts related to continuous-time and
discrete-time signals and systems. We have presented both an intuitive picture
of what signals and systems are through several examples and a mathematical
representation for signals and systems that we will use throughout the book.
Specifically, we introduced graphical and mathematical representation of signals
and used these representations in performing transformations of the independent
variable. We also defined and examined several basic signals, both in continuous
time and in discrete time. These included complex exponential signals,
sinusoidal signals, and unit impulse and step functions. In addition, we
investigated the concept of periodicity for continuous-time and discrete-time
signals.

In developing some of the elementary ideas related to systems, we introduced
block diagrams to facilitate our discussions concerning the interconnection of
systems, and we defined a number of important properties of systems, including
causality, stability, time-invariance, and linearity.

The primary focus in most of this book will be on the class of LTI systems, both
in continuous time and discrete time. These systems play a particularly
important role in system analysis and design, in part due to the fact that many
systems encountered in nature can be successfully modeled as linear and time
invariant. Furthermore, as we shall see in the following chapters, the
properties of linearity and time invariance allows us to analyze in detail the
behavior of LTI systems.

   Together with Fourier and Wavelet Signal Processing (to be published by CUP),
   the two books aim to present the essential principles in signal processing
   along with mathematical tools and algorithms for signal representation. They
   comprehensively cover both classical Fourier techniques and newer basis
   constructions from filter banks and multiresolution analysisâ€”wavelets.
   Furthermore, they gives a synthetic view from basic mathematical principles,
   to construction of bases, all the way to concrete applications.

5. Signal processing for communications, by Palo Prandoni and Martin
   Vetterli. [[https://www.sp4comm.org/index.html][Signal Processing for Communications]]

   With a novel, less formal approach to the subject, the authors have written a
   book with the conviction that signal processing should be taught to be fun.
   The treatment is less focused on the mathematics and more on the conceptual
   and practical aspects but the book remains an engineering text, with the goal
   of helping students solve real-world problems. In this vein, the last chapter
   pulls together all the topics discussed throughout the book into an in-depth
   look at the development of an end-to-end communication system, namely, a
   modem for communicating digital information over an analog channel.

convey information. Systems transform signals. This book introduces the
mathematical models used to design and understand both. It is intended for
students interested in developing a deep understanding of how to digitally
create and manipulate signals to measure and control the physical world and to
enhance human experience and communication. This book is based on several years
of successful classroom use at the University of California, Berkeley. The
material starts with an early introduction to applications, well before students
have built up enough theory to fully analyze the applications. This motivates
students to learn the theory and allows students to master signals and systems
at the sophomore level. The material motivates signals and systems through sound
and images. Calculus is the only prerequisite.
